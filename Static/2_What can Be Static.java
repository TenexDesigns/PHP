In PHP, the `static` keyword can be applied to variables, methods, and properties within classes. Here's a breakdown of what can be static:

1. **Static Variables**: Static variables are variables that are shared across all instances of a class. They retain their value even after the function call where they are declared has ended.

    ```php
    class Example {
        public static $count = 0;

        public function incrementCount() {
            self::$count++;
        }
    }

    Example::$count = 10;
    echo Example::$count; // Outputs: 10
    ```

2. **Static Methods**: Static methods belong to the class itself rather than to instances of the class. They can be called directly on the class without needing an instance.

    ```php
    class Example {
        public static function hello() {
            return "Hello, world!";
        }
    }

    echo Example::hello(); // Outputs: Hello, world!
    ```

3. **Static Properties**: Static properties are shared among all instances of a class. They are accessed using the class name rather than an instance variable.

    ```php
    class Example {
        public static $count = 0;

        public function incrementCount() {
            self::$count++;
        }
    }

    Example::$count = 10;
    echo Example::$count; // Outputs: 10
    ```

4. **Static Constants**: Class constants can also be declared as static within a class. They are accessed using the class name and can't be changed after they are defined.

    ```php
    class Example {
        public static const PI = 3.14;
    }

    echo Example::PI; // Outputs: 3.14
    ```

5. **Static Functions**: Functions outside of classes cannot be declared as static in PHP. However, functions within classes can be declared as static.

    ```php
    class Example {
        public static function hello() {
            return "Hello, world!";
        }
    }

    echo Example::hello(); // Outputs: Hello, world!
    ```

In summary, in PHP, the `static` keyword can be applied to variables, methods, properties, and constants within classes to indicate that they belong to the class itself rather than to instances of the class.
