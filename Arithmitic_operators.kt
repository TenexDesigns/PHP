              ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

ADDITION

$X = 10;
$Y =2;
$Z= null;

$z = $x + $y;

echo $z       ---------------> returns 12 on browser



            

SUBTRACTION

$X = 10;
$Y =2;
$Z= null;

$z = $x - $y;

echo $z       ---------------> returns 8 on browser



MULTIPLICATION

$X = 10;
$Y =2;
$Z= null;

$z = $x * $y;

echo $z       ---------------> returns 20 on browser


POWER

$X = 10;
$Y =2;
$Z= null;

$z = $x ** $y;

echo $z       ---------------> returns 100 on browser



MODULAS

$X = 10;
$Y =3;
$Z= null;

$z = $x + $y;

echo $z       ---------------> returns 1 on browser.It returns the remianer of a divsion. This can be used to determine if a number is even or not



              

DIVISION

$X = 10;
$Y =2;
$Z= null;

$z = $x / $y;

echo $z       ---------------> returns 5 on browser






                                             INCREMENT AND DECREMENT OPERATORS


INCREMENT OPERATORS ++

  
  
  WE CAN USE THE INCREMENT OPERATOR TO INCREASE THE VALUE BY ONE

$counter = 0

$counter ++;

echo $counter;  This increases the value by one. So this will produce 1



DECREMENT OPERATOR --
  
  
    
  WE CAN USE THE INCREMENT OPERATOR TO DECREASE THE VALUE BY ONE

$counter = 0

$counter --;

echo $counter;  This decreases the value by one. So this ill produce -1
  
  


WE CAN ALSO INCREASE THE VALUESBY MORE THAN ONE


$counter = 0

$counter += 3;

echo $counter;  This increases the value by three. So this ill produce 3


WE CAN ALSO DECREASE VALUES BY MORE THAN ONE


$counter = 0

$counter -=4;

echo $counter;  This decreases the value by 4. So this ill produce -4
