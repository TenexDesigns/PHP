Yes, you're correct! Namespaces in PHP serve a similar purpose to packages in Java, helping to organize code into logical groups and prevent naming conflicts. However, there are indeed differences in how they are implemented and managed.

In Java, each package typically corresponds to a directory in the file system, and each class within that package is defined in its own file. This strict file structure is enforced by the language and build tools.

On the other hand, in PHP, namespaces are declared within individual files using the `namespace` keyword, as you mentioned. While it's common practice to organize PHP files into directories that reflect their namespaces, PHP does not enforce a strict one-class-per-file rule. This means that you can have multiple classes (or other namespace elements like functions or constants) defined within a single PHP file, all belonging to the same namespace.

Here's an example of how PHP files might be organized with namespaces:

```
project/
└── src/
    ├── Html/
    │   ├── Table.php
    │   ├── Row.php
    │   └── Cell.php
    ├── Database/
    │   ├── Connection.php
    │   └── QueryBuilder.php
    └── Utils/
        └── HelperFunctions.php
```

In this example, the `Html`, `Database`, and `Utils` directories represent namespaces, and each PHP file within those directories contains classes or other namespace elements belonging to the corresponding namespace. For instance, the `Table.php`, `Row.php`, and `Cell.php` files all belong to the `Html` namespace.

This flexibility in PHP's approach to namespaces allows developers to organize their code in a way that makes sense for their project without being constrained by strict file structure requirements. However, it also places the responsibility on the developer to maintain a logical organization and prevent namespace pollution within their codebase.
