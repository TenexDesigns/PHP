$user_name = "Bro_code";
$phone = "123-333-44";

PHP provides a wide range of built-in functions for working with strings. Here are some of the most commonly used string functions in PHP:

strlen(): Returns the length of a string.

strpos(): Returns the position of the first occurrence of a substring in a string.

substr(): Returns a portion of a string.

strtolower(): Converts a string to lowercase.

strtoupper(): Converts a string to uppercase.

trim(): Removes whitespace or other characters from the beginning and end of a string.

str_replace(): Replaces all occurrences of a substring with another string.

str_split(): Splits a string into an array.

implode(): Joins array elements with a string.

explode(): Splits a string into an array using a specified delimiter.

ucfirst(): Converts the first character of a string to uppercase.

ucwords(): Converts the first character of each word in a string to uppercase.

strcmp(): Compares two strings.

strcasecmp(): Compares two strings without considering case.

sprintf(): Formats a string using placeholders.


These functions are just a few examples of what you can do with strings in PHP.
There are many more functions available in the PHP string library that can help you manipulate and work with strings in a variety of ways.



Certainly! Here are some code examples using the string functions mentioned in my previous response:

strlen():

$str = "Hello world!";
$length = strlen($str); // $length is now 12


strpos():

$str = "Hello world!";
$position = strpos($str, "world"); // $position is now 6




substr():

$str = "Hello world!";
$sub = substr($str, 6, 5); // $sub is now "world"


strtolower():

$str = "Hello World!";
$lowercase = strtolower($str); // $lowercase is now "hello world!"




strtoupper():


$str = "Hello World!";
$uppercase = strtoupper($str); // $uppercase is now "HELLO WORLD!"



trim():

$str = "  Hello World!   ";
$trimmed = trim($str); // $trimmed is now "Hello World!"



str_replace():


$str = "Hello World!";
$newStr = str_replace("World", "Universe", $str); // $newStr is now "Hello Universe!"



str_split():

$str = "Hello World!";
$arr = str_split($str); // $arr is now ["H", "e", "l", "l", "o", " ", "W", "o", "r", "l", "d", "!"]





implode():

$arr = ["Hello", "World", "!"];
$str = implode(" ", $arr); // $str is now "Hello World !"


explode():


$str = "Hello World!";
$arr = explode(" ", $str); // $arr is now ["Hello", "World!"]



ucfirst():


$str = "hello world!";
$ucfirst = ucfirst($str); // $ucfirst is now "Hello world!"



ucwords():


$str = "hello world!";
$ucwords = ucwords($str); // $ucwords is now "Hello World!"



strcmp():


$str1 = "hello";
$str2 = "world";
$result = strcmp($str1, $str2); // $result is a negative integer (-1) because "hello" is less than "world"


strcasecmp():


$str1 = "Hello";
$str2 = "WORLD";
$result = strcasecmp($str1, $str2); // $result is 0 because "Hello" is the same as "WORLD" when case is ignored



sprintf():

$name = "John";
$age = 30;
$message = sprintf("My name is %s and I am %d years old.", $name, $age); // $message is now "My name is John and I am 30 years old."
