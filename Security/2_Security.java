When using PHP, besides Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), there are several other security issues to consider:

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: This attack tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. It uses the identity and privileges of the victim to perform an undesired function on their behalf.
- **SQL Injection**: Attackers can manipulate SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to data, modify data, or even delete data.
- **Command Injection**: Similar to SQL injection but targets system commands instead of SQL statements.
- **Session Hijacking**: Attackers intercept session IDs to impersonate users.
- **Directory Traversal**: Attackers exploit file paths to access restricted directories or files.

To mitigate these issues, PHP provides various mechanisms:

- **Input Validation**: Ensure that all inputs are validated against expected formats and patterns.
- **Output Encoding**: Encode output to prevent attackers from injecting malicious scripts.
- **Use Prepared Statements**: For database queries, use prepared statements to avoid SQL injection.
- **Secure Session Management**: Implement secure session management practices to prevent session hijacking.
- **Limit File Uploads**: Restrict file uploads to known safe types and sizes.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep PHP and all extensions up to date to benefit from the latest security patches.

Frameworks like Zend (now Laminas), Laravel, CakePHP, and others offer additional layers of security:

- **Laminas**: Offers long-term support and ready-to-go adapters for commercial PHP applications, enhancing security through stability and support [2].
- **Laravel**: Provides robust security features such as encryption, password protection, and tools to prevent SQL injection attacks. It also encourages the use of its ORM (Eloquent) for safer database interactions [4].
- **CakePHP**: Known for its strong security features, including data validation, data sanitation, prevention from SQL injection attacks, XSS prevention, and authentication components. Its document-oriented model adds another layer of security by structuring data differently [4].

Each framework has its approach to addressing security concerns, leveraging PHP's core security features and adding additional safeguards tailored to their design principles. Developers should choose a framework based on their project's specific needs and the framework's alignment with those needs, especially regarding security considerations.
