session - Used to store information on a user t be used across multiple pages.
A user is assigned a session id e.g login credentials




Sessions in PHP are a way to store data on the server-side, i.e.,
on the web server, to be used across multiple requests within a single user session
Sessions are often used to maintain user authentication, track user activity, and store user preferences.

To use sessions in PHP, you need to start a session by calling the session_start() function at the beginning of your PHP script.
Once a session is started, you can store data in the $_SESSION superglobal array.



// Start a session
session_start();

// Store data in the session
$_SESSION['username'] = 'John';

// Get data from the session
echo $_SESSION['username'];

To use sessions in PHP, you need to start a session by calling the session_start() function at the beginning of your PHP script. Once a session is started, you can store data in the $_SESSION superglobal array.

Example:

php
Copy code
// Start a session
session_start();

// Store data in the session
$_SESSION['username'] = 'John';

// Get data from the session
echo $_SESSION['username'];
In this example, we start a session using the session_start() function, and then store the value John in the $_SESSION superglobal array with the key username. 
We then retrieve the value of username from the $_SESSION superglobal and print it to the screen.

Session data is stored on the web server and associated with a unique session ID, which is sent to the users browser as a cookie.
The session ID is used to identify the users session on subsequent requests, so the server can retrieve the correct session data.

Its important to note that session data is stored on the server-side and is not accessible to the user, unlike cookies which are stored on the client-side.
However, session data is vulnerable to session hijacking attacks, where an attacker steals a users session ID and uses it to impersonate the user.
To prevent session hijacking, its important to use secure session management practices,
such as regenerating the session ID after authentication, using SSL/TLS to encrypt session data, and setting a short session timeout.
